The new OT collection has a playbook that will configure multiple things on the **Enterprise Core** FortiGate. This work has been done ahead of time to speed up the workshop.

In OT environments there is heavy red tape around blocking new traffic. In short, all OT devices *must* be able to communicate to other OT devices. If there is malware identified on an OT device, the spread should be *mitigated* and not blocked outright. This is what the policy above does. The policy will *only* allow **isolated** OT assets to communicate to devices in the OT Assets group, and nothing else.
