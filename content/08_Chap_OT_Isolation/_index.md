The convergence of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) infrastructures continues to accelerate. And as publicized attacks and industry warnings increase, organizations must now prioritize securing their OT assets and infrastructure. OT assets have become more open and dependent on network communications and increasingly connected to the larger corporate network. As a result, they are now potentially vulnerable to outside attacks ranging from sabotage to ransomware. Specialized cybersecurity products provide protection and detection across OT operational levels and at the OT/IT network boundary, but monitoring, investigating, and responding to alerts from this array of products is complex and error-prone.

## Objectives

- Understand OT
- Install a Solution Pack
- Isolate an Asset

## Time to Complete

Estimated: 20 Minutes
