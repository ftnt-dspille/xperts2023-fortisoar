Finally, we have build out a process to remove an Asset from the OT Isolated Group on the Enterprise Core FortiGate. In this scenario, the Network team's process for removing an isolated device through automation will require a manager's approval. The playbook has a static value of "CS Admin" set, but this could be any user or Team in FortiSOAR, or even a user outside of FortiSOAR.
