In this section we will configure FortiSOAR to retrieve FortiAnalyzer events.

---

1. Go to the **Data Ingestion** module inside the **Automation** group. ![Data ingestion dropdown](dataing.png)

1. Look for the **FortiAnalyzer Connector**. This was setup by default in the lab but comes from configuring the FortiAnalyzer Connector Config.
1. Click the **1 Configuration Available** dropdown.

1. We need to **fetch some data** to see what the data looks like. ![Fetch data button](fetchdata.png)

1. You can tweak how you pull the sample data. Increased it to **60 minutes** to make sure you get a good sample

1. The example data needs to be mapped to FortiSOAR fields for creating records. Some defaults have been applied but we can change this. ![Field Mapping page](dataing2.png)

1. Click into the **Name** field and change it to include the **devicename** and **subject** of the event. Then **Save the Mapping & Continue**.

1. Schedule the fetch to run every **15 minutes** and **limit the execution to one** active instance at a time. Change the hour from “0”, shown in this picture to “*” to be every 15 minutes.  Then **Save Settings & Continue**. ![Schedule Settings](sched.png)

1. Click the Trigger Ingestion Now button to kick off the playbook. ![Trigger ingestion now button](triging.png)
