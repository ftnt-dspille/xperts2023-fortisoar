    - Remove the “**/admin/**” from the FortiMAIL URL to access the web-mail login page.
    - Login using “socuser1” and ```$3curityFabric``` and check your emails.
    - You should have an email saying, “**A task has been assigned**”.
    - Open the email and click the link to the task and then login to FortiSOAR using “socuser1” and ```$3curityFabric```. ![Mail view](mailtask.png)
