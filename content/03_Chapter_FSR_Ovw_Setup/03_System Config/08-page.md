Earlier in this lab you should have retrieved an API token for your IP Quality Score account. You will use this here.

1. Go to Automation and Connectors. ![Connector Navigation](connectors.png)
1. In the Manage Tab search for “ip quality score”.
1. Edit the connector configuration to have your IP Quality Score API Key from section [External Requirements - External Accts]({{< relref "/02_chapter_ext_reqts/02-page.md#ipqualityscore" >}}). You can call the configuration whatever you like – in this lab we called it “mylab”. ![IPQuality score connector configuration](ipqs.png)
