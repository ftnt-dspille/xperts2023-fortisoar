![Complete Task](check_box.svg?classes=inline)

We want to make sure the users we imported through the FortiSOAR **Import Wizard** are active. Users that are imported are disabled by default and their passwords are not created. Look at the user status and take note of the **Active** column of the users. Only the CS Admin User is enabled

---

- First, we need to make sure all the users show as **Active**. If everyone is active then in theory you can skip the rest of this section or review it for information purposes. If you have ANY problems logging in as a Soc User then revisit this section and perform the **activation** and **set password** actions. You can find all of this under **System>Security Management>Users**
- If there is not a green check then you need to **activate** the users one at a time and also **set the password** to the lab default of ```$3curityFabric```. This can be a time-consuming manual process. If your users are not active go ahead and activate one manually if you’d like. Be sure to reset the password to the default ```$3curityFabric```

*Alternatively, you can use a playbook to simplify your efforts as a FortiSOAR admin and script the activation and password setting for each user. See the next step for details.*
