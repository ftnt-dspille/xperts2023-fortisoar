The goal of this section is to complete an audit of the firewall policy and deny a policy. The next steps on removing the policy from the network would depend on other business requirements as our objective is simply to perform an audit.

<!-- 3. If you do NOT see a pop-up then look for the Manual Notification in the toolbar. ![](manual.png) -->

4. Click on the **Next Steps** field dropdown (sometimes called a picklist), and you will see 3 options. Select **Mark as Denied** and enter “**This should not be allowed**” in the Comments field.
Click **Submit**. ![](notallow.png)

5. Check the Execution History for this policy by clicking on the  icon at the top right. You will see all of the playbooks that have executed on this specific record. ![](history.png)

6. Wait for the playbook “**> Update comments on the FortiGate**” to complete. (you’re looking for a green check box to the right). ![](pbcomp.png?height=400px)

7. In the FortiGate config we can see that we updated the policy with a comment. (You may need to modify the heading layout of your firewall policy screen to see the comments column). ![](fgconf.png?height=200px)
