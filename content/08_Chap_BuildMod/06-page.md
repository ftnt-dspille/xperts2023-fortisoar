The goal of this section is to complete an audit of the firewall policy and approve a policy. We will then update the FortiGate config with comments indicating that this policy has been reviewed. We could also put rules inside FortiSOAR to repeat this audit according to business requirements.

1. Go back to the **Policies** Module and click on the **dmz-to-inet** record to open the policy.

2. At the bottom of the page, click the blue **Execute** button, then click “**Start Policy Audit**”. You will see a Manual Input Box appear.
